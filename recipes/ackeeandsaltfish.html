    <p><h2><em>Description</em></h2></p>
    <p>Introduced during the colonial times to the Jamaican breakfast table by enslaved West African's who combined their ackee fruit with the local salt fish.
        The perfect mix of African and Jamaican foods now famously known as Ackee and Saltfish.Saltfish is a white fish; usually cod, haddock or pollock, dried and salted to preserve it. You may hear it called salt fish, salt cod or dry salted codfish.
        The drying and salting method preserves the fish for over a year without refrigerating, which is one of the reasons it became a popular staple worldwide in the 17th century.Ackee is a Jamaican fruit rich in nutrition, especially protein and vitamin C.  Fresh ackee is a pear-shaped fruit with 2-4 openings that will fully open when ripe and ready to pick. Ackee and saltfish is often served at breakfast or brunch with fried dumplings. Alternatively, serve with rice and peas for dinner.</p>
